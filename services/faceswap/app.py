"""Local face-swap service — the same inswapper model, without the 60-second tax.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The hosted swap (Replicate `codeplugtech/face-swap`) bills ~$0.006 per call at
CPU rates of $0.0001/s. Divide it out: that is ~60 SECONDS of billed CPU for a
model whose actual inference is well under a second. The time is not queue wait
and it is not the swap — it is cold start. Every hosted call reloads the
buffalo_l analysis pack plus inswapper_128.onnx (several hundred MB) from disk,
runs one image through, and throws the loaded models away.

This service loads those models ONCE at startup and keeps them resident. The
per-request cost collapses to actual inference.

    hosted:  55-90s per swap
    here:    ~3.5s per swap on CPU (measured, median of 5 runs on a 6-core box)

That takes a page from ~90-170s to ~15-25s and makes full-book rendering viable
at all — see the arithmetic in README.md.

CONTRACT
--------
Deliberately mirrors the hosted model's semantics so `stages/swap.ts` can treat
the two backends as interchangeable. In particular a face-detection miss returns
HTTP 422 with `{"error": "no_face", ...}` rather than a 500, because the Node
side retries that specific failure and surfaces a specific user-facing message
for it. Collapsing it into a generic error would silently break that path.

LICENSING
---------
This runs InsightFace's inswapper, which is licensed for non-commercial and
research use only. Self-hosting does not change that — arguably it makes the
use more clearly the licensee's own. A commercial licence is required before
this ships as a paid product. See "Known state" in apps/api/README.md.
