// Combined dev-convenience entry point: API + worker in ONE process, for
// low-friction local iteration. server.ts + worker-process.ts is the same
// pair split across two processes, so the worker's CPU-bound pipeline work
// (sharp, TF.js face detection, base64 encode/decode of image buffers)
// can't stall this process's ability to serve HTTP/SSE — that split is what
// `npm run server` + `npm run worker` gives you and what production should
// run. Kept because it's what `npm run dev`/`npm start` already point to and
// what the demo has been verified against; not being removed to avoid
// breaking that.
