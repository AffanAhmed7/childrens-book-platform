// CONSUMER side of the per-stage queue split (see queueStageRunner.ts for the
// producer side and the full design rationale). One process, dedicated to
// exactly ONE stage, selected by the STAGE env var. Run as many instances as
// you want, per stage — e.g. more `swap`/`restore` workers if Replicate
// latency is the bottleneck, more `heal`/`eyes` workers if local CPU is.
//
// THE WARM-UP POINT: because an instance only ever processes one stage, it
// never cold-starts switching between kinds of work. heal/eyes both call
// detectFaces (faceDetect.ts), which lazily loads a TF.js blazeface model on
// first use and keeps it resident for the life of the process — warmed here
// explicitly at boot (mirrors worker.ts's own warm-up) so the very first job
// this instance ever picks up doesn't pay that cost. A repaint/swap/restore
// instance never touches that model at all. Only enabled end-to-end when
// env.STAGE_EXECUTION === "queued" in worker.ts — with the default ("direct")
// these processes have nothing to consume, and running them is harmless but
// pointless.
