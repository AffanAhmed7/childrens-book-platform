// STAGE 2 of 5 — sharpen identity to exactly this child.
//
// The repaint gets the child broadly right; this pins the likeness.
//
// TWO BACKENDS, one contract. `SWAP_BACKEND` selects:
//
//   replicate (default) — hosted. Tries the codeplugtech/face-swap DEPLOYMENT
//                         (dedicated T4 GPU) first, falls back to the plain
//                         ddvinh1/face-swap-gpu model call on any failure — see
//                         swapViaReplicate below.
//   local               — services/faceswap, the same inswapper model self-hosted.
//                         Errors if the service is down (strict; for testing).
//   auto                — try local first, fall back to hosted on ANY local
//                         failure. Fast when the box is healthy, slow-but-working
//                         when it isn't. The production-resilient setting.
//
// WHY LOCAL EXISTS: the hosted call bills ~$0.006 at Replicate's CPU rate of
// $0.0001/s, i.e. ~60 SECONDS of billed CPU, for a model whose real inference is
// under a second. The minute is cold start — it reloads several hundred MB of
// weights per call. Self-hosted with resident models the stage drops from
// ~55-90s to ~3.5s (measured), taking a page from ~90-170s to ~15-25s. That is what
// makes full-book rendering viable at all. See services/faceswap/README.md.
//
// Default stays `replicate` on purpose: the local service needs weights that are
// not in this repo, so anyone without it running is unaffected.
//
// LICENSING: both backends run InsightFace's inswapper, which is
// non-commercial/research licensed. Self-hosting does not change that. Most open
// face-swap tools (roop, facefusion, SimSwap) derive from the same model and
// inherit the restriction. This must be resolved before the product is sold.

// PRIMARY (2026-07-23): a Replicate DEPLOYMENT — codeplugtech/face-swap
// (the same model previously run generically on CPU, ~55-90s) now pinned to a
// dedicated Nvidia T4 GPU instance, owned by the "ihtesham" Replicate org.
// Deployments use their own endpoint shape (deployments/<owner>/<name>/
// predictions, no `version` field — the deployment itself pins the version)
// and their own token (REPLICATE_API_TOKEN was switched globally to this
// org's token at the user's explicit instruction — repaint/restore now
// authenticate as this account too).
const FACE_SWAP_DEPLOYMENT_OWNER = "ihtesham";
const FACE_SWAP_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = "face-swap";

// FALLBACK: the plain (non-deployment) model call this project used right
// before the deployment above — ddvinh1/face-swap-gpu, ~1s warm/22s cold,
// ~$0.0002/call. Pinned to a version hash because the version-based
// /predictions endpoint requires one, and pinning stops behaviour drifting if
// the owner pushes an update. Used automatically if the deployment call
// fails for any reason (see swapViaReplicate) — e.g. the deployment's single
// max instance is still cold-starting, or Replicate has an issue scoped to
// deployments specifically. Same input contract either way (input_image =
// target artwork, swap_image = child photo).

// THROTTLE for the deployment specifically (2026-07-24). The deployment is
// configured with max_instances: 1 (Cloudflare/Replicate dashboard setting,
// not code) — firing more than one concurrent call at it doesn't parallelize
// anything, it just contends for the single instance. Confirmed live: doing
// exactly that produced real 429s from Replicate on the deployment endpoint.
//
// This gate limits in-flight deployment calls to DEPLOYMENT_MAX_CONCURRENT
// (default 1, matching max_instances) and, critically, RELEASES THE INSTANT a
// call finishes — success or failure — so the next waiting call starts almost
// immediately (bounded only by the poll interval), rather than idling and
// risking the single instance scaling back down between requests. A waiter
// gives up after DEPLOYMENT_LOCK_WAIT_BUDGET_MS and falls straight to the
// plain model call instead of queueing indefinitely behind a busy or stuck
// instance — the render pipeline keeps moving either way.
//
// Same dual-mode pattern as replicate.ts's rate limiter: Redis-backed (shared
// across every stage-worker process) when REDIS_URL is set, in-memory
// fallback otherwise — correct for the CLI/homepage_local, which are always a
// single process, but can still run swap concurrently across character crops
// on a multi-character page, so even the in-memory case needs a real gate,
// not just a comment saying "don't."
